### Bikeshare Data Project

### Description
This project analyses data from **Chicago, Washington, or New York City** on their bikeshare schemes.
Users choose which _city_ they'd like to view, and can filter by _month_ and/or _weekday_, or view all the data together.
The project displays:
* The most popular times for bikeshare hire
* The most popular stations for bikeshare hire
* The total and mean duration for bikeshare hire
* The number of users by type
* The number of users by gender
* The earliest, most recent, and most common birth years of users

### Files used
The project is run from the file `bikeshare.py`, and uses data from `chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, and `washington.csv`.

### Credits
To help with some of the pandas time conversion functions and methods, I consulted **Stack Overflow**, which proved very useful.
